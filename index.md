# [FOSDEM 24 - Emulator Development Room CFP](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/emulator/)
The Call for papers for the FOSDEM emulator development room is hereby open!

Once again, the upcoming FOSDEM 24 will take place at the [Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, Belgium](https://fosdem.org/2024/practical/transportation/).

### What is FOSDEM?
~~Stolen~~/Borrowed from the website:

_**FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.**
Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels._ 


#### Important stuff:
- FOSDEM is free to attend. There is no registration.
- [FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/)
- [FOSDEM code of conduct](https://fosdem.org/2024/practical/conduct/)
- [Emulator devroom schedule](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/emulator/)

### Desirable topics
Really **anything** goes, but here are some ideas (for inspiration):
- Console emulator development
- Computer emulator development
- Hardware on hardware emulation
- OS emulation development
- Virtual Machine development
- Emulation history
- ...

#### Topic overlap
Some topics might be suitable or overlap with other rooms (such as the [Retro](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/retrocomputing/) & [Virtualization](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/virtualization-and-cloud-infrastructure/) rooms). In such cases we might contact the speaker and point that out, but ultimately it is up to the speaker where the talk should land.

#### Desirable speakers
We honestly don't care. Experienced speakers are very welcome, but hobbyists and/or first time speakers are equally welcome. As long as you have passion and/or knowledge you care to share.

### How to submit your proposal
Pentabarf is no longer available, instead you can submit talks through [pretalx](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2024).

### What should be in your submission
- name
- short bio
- contact info
- title (funny titles are ~~required~~/appreciated)
- abstract (what you're gonna talk about)
- duration

### Important Dates
- **December 9th: submission deadline**
  - FAQ - is the submission deadline final?
    - Technically speaking, you can submit talks as long as pretalx will allow it
    - However, talks submitted before the 9th get a higher precedence
- ASAP: announcement selected talks
- February 3rd: FOSDEM!

### Volunteering

_FOSDEM needs you! Every year, the FOSDEM team is assisted by an enthusiastic team of volunteers to help out with various tasks and make the event a fun and safe place for all our visitors._

There are some benefits to being a volunteer, but most importantly you help make FOSDEM possible :)
